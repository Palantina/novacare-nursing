            participated in a pilot program that led to the establishment of the Community Rapid
            Response Service. I also spent several years working in the beautiful Georgetown
            community as a nurse, working in both the community and the local hospital.

            My extensive clinical nursing background includes ventilation management, trauma care,
            palliative care, complex bowel and urinary care, complex wound care, mental health care,
            and post-surgical care. I am also highly skilled in cannulation and intravenous (IV)
            infusion.

            Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of
            individuals from various backgrounds. I have been a part of the lives of many people at
            their best and worst times, and it has been a privilege to provide care for everyone.
            Additionally, I have a genetic disorder that has presented challenges to my physical and
            mental health, which has enhanced my emotional awareness and made me a more empathetic
            and practical nurse.

            In recent years, I have transitioned into the home care sector as a Clinical Lead and
            Care Manager, providing high-quality care to both aged care and disability clients.
            This role has further enhanced my clinical skills, including behaviour support planning
            and care package management. I take pride in being a dedicated professional whose
            primary objective is to ensure that my clients receive evidence-based, best-practice care.
            Furthermore, I am committed to delivering holistic care tailored to meet your individual
            needs.
